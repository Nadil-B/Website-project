<p><strong>"Leaders under pressure must keep themselves clean morally.
The relativism of the social sciens will never do.
They must lead by example, must be able to implant high-mindness to their followers,
and must have earned their followers' respect by demonstrating integrity."- Vice Admiral James B. Stockdale 1987</Strong></p>
