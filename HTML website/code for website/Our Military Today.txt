<p><strong>Global war on terror (2001-presant day)-</strong>Britian along with many other nations around the globe
are enganged in a military, political, economic and diplomatic efforts which are all about combating the Islamic 
Millitancy in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Virtually all British military engagments during the 21st century are 
primarly focused on groups such as al-Qaida, The Taliban, ISIS, Boko Haram, al-Shabaab along with other similar 
groups within the Middle East. There were two major wars against existing goverments involving Saddam Hussein's

<p><strong>Afganistan war (2001-2021)-</strong>The UK along with many allies such as the United States all joined forces
in an attempt to oust the Taliban as well as al-Qaida from power as a direct consequence of their involvement with the
September 11th attacks. Recently the United States announced that they were starting to pull out of the country prompting
Britian and its allies to do the same as they could not hold the country on their own without United States support. As a
result of this, the Taliban manged to sweep through the country with relative ease prompting Nato forces to set up a 
checkpoint at Kabul airport guraded by Nato forces. Goverments around the world used military and civilian aircraft to evacuate
civilian and goverment personel as well as Afghan nationals who worked for Western goverments in an attempt to bring them to safety.

the decade long conflict.
